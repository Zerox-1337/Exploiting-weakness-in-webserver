# Exploiting-weakness-in-webserver

The purpose of this project is exploit a fabricated weakness on a LTH server to change your grade by generating a HMAC using the name and grade of the student without knowing the secret key k. In the LTH server chrcmp that compares two character with each other is slow. 

After studying the server it can be seen that website takes longer to respond if there are more incorrect signature digits. This program connects to the site and guesses the signature one hex digit a time. To find the correct hex digit at each position the time it takes to load the website is simply compared for all the possible digits value of each position. The digit that gives the least amount of load time is the correct digit at that position and is put into the signature. Eventually the correct signature will be found. 

Important note: this is obviously not an actual weakness of the LTH server, but one that was fabricated for learning purposes.
